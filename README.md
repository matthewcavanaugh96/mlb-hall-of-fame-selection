# mlb-hall-of-fame-selection
Using batting statistics for every player who hit at least 100 home runs and retired no later than 2018, predict whether each one has been named to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Attached are my main project notebook, a separate notebook for data cleaning, the dataset, and my PowerPoint file.

I intend to make more revisions to this project soon, including:
- Further model validation
- Extension of the retirement deadline to 2019 (with the Hall of Fame 2025 Class now having been announced)
